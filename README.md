CADS is a robust, fully automated framework for segmenting 167 anatomical structures in Computed Tomography (CT), spanning from head to knee regions across diverse anatomical systems.

The framework consists of two main components:

1. **CADS-dataset**: 
   - 22,022 CT volumes with complete annotations for 167 anatomical structures.
   - Most extensive whole-body CT dataset, exceeding current collections in both scale (18x more CT scans) and anatomical coverage (60% more distinct targets).
   - Data collected from publicly available datasets and private hospital data, spanning 100+ imaging centers across 16 countries.
   - Diverse coverage of clinical variability, protocols, and pathological conditions.
   - Built through an automated pipeline with pseudo-labeling and unsupervised quality control.

2. **CADS-model**: 
   - An open-source model suite for automated whole-body segmentation.
   - Performance validated on both public challenges and real-world hospital cohorts.
   - Available as Python script run (this GitHub repo) for flexible command-line usage.
   - Also available as a user-friendly 3D Slicer plugin with UI interface, simple installation and one-click inference.

## Installation
1. **Install 3D Slicer**  
   Download and install the latest version of [3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org/).  
   Compatibility note (verified on September 5, 2025): Our extension has been tested with preview release **5.9.0**.

2. **Install PyTorch**  
   Slicer makes it easy to set up the correct PyTorch version:  
   - Open `Extension Manager` in Slicer â†’ search for `PyTorch` â†’ click `Install`.  
     (Slicer will ask you to restart after installation.)  
   - After restarting, go to the `PyTorch Utils` module.  
     In the `Torch version requirement` box, type `<2.6`, then click `Install PyTorch`. A PyTorch version (>= 2.0.0 and <2.6.0) compatible with your machine should be installed.

3. **Install CADS Extension**  
   - ~~Open `Extension Manager` â†’ search for `CADS` â†’ click `Install`.
     (Again, restart Slicer after installation.)~~
   - ~~Once restarted, open the `CADS` module in Slicer and you should see the CADS user interface ready to use.~~

   ðŸš§ **In progress**: Installing CADS directly through the 3D Slicer Extension Manager is in progress and will be available soon!  

   In the meantime, please use the manual installation described below:

   - Clone this repository to your machine: 
      - `git clone git@github.com:murong-xu/SlicerCADS.git`
      - Or simply download it from https://github.com/murong-xu/SlicerCADS
   - Tell Slicer where to find it:
      - Open 3D Slicer
      - Go to `Edit`(the very top-left corner) â†’ `Application Settings` â†’ `Modules`.
      - Under `Additional module paths`, click the `arrow` on the right, then hit `Add`.
      - Navigate to the **SlicerCADS** folder you just downloaded, open it, and select the **CADS** subfolder.
      - Press OK and restart Slicer.
   - Once restarted, open the `CADS` module in Slicer and you should see the user interface ready to use.

## Quick Start
1. **Open the CADS extension** in 3D Slicer.  
2. **Load your CT image file.**  
3. **Set the input parameters:**  
   - `Input volume`: The CT image you want to segment.  
   - `Segmentation task`: Choose a specific task from the dropdown menu (the targets for each task will be displayed in the UI), or select **All** to run every task in sequence.  
   - `Target mode`: 
     - `All targets`: Generate a complete segmentation for the chosen task.  
     - `Select targets`: Pick only the structures you want from the list below.  
   - `Advanced options`: 
     - `Use standard segment names` (default: *Yes*): Displays segmentation results using SNOMED-CT terminology.  
     - `Force to use CPU` (default: *No*): Runs inference on CPU if you donâ€™t have a GPU. (Note: CPU is slower and will take longer.)  
     - `CADS Python package`:  
       - `Force install dependencies`: Re-installs the CADS package.  
       - `Get package information`: Shows the current CADS package version.  
4. **Run**: Click `Apply`, the CADS-model will begin segmenting your CT scan.  
5. **View the results:**  
   - Once finished, the results will appear automatically. You can then go to the `Data` tab to view the list of structures.
   - You can view the segmentations in the three orthogonal 2D views, or drag them into the 3D viewer.  
   - Hovering over a structure name will show detailed structure information in SNOMED-CT terminology.

## Troubleshooting
**CUDA Memory Error (torch.OutOfMemoryError)** 

Even though we designed the model to automatically manage available GPU/CPU resources during prediction, you may still run into out-of-memory errors. This usually happens if:
1. Your GPU has very limited VRAM (e.g., around 4 GB), or
2. The input CT image is large.

In these cases, we recommend switching to `Force to use CPU` mode. It will be slower than GPU (CPU-only needs around 10+ minutes for a chest+abdomen CT), but it will run more reliably and avoid memory issues.
